- ‚úÖ Email/password login
- ‚úÖ Logout functionality
- ‚úÖ Persistent sessions (Firebase Auth)
- ‚úÖ User profiles stored in Firestore (displayName, color)
- ‚úÖ Automatic color assignment per user

**Canvas & Controls**
- ‚úÖ 5000√ó5000px virtual canvas space
- ‚úÖ Pan with middle-click + drag
- ‚úÖ Vertical scroll with mouse wheel
- ‚úÖ Zoom with Ctrl + wheel
- ‚úÖ Document-level mouse listeners for smooth panning

**Rectangle Shapes**
- ‚úÖ Click-drag creation with rectangle tool
- ‚úÖ Selection with click (blue border for local, colored for remote)
- ‚úÖ Drag to move
- ‚úÖ Resize from corners (diagonal resize with smooth flipping)
- ‚úÖ Resize from edges (single-axis resize)
- ‚úÖ Rotate from corner zones (30px hit areas, pivots around center)
- ‚úÖ Alt+drag to duplicate (original stays in place, duplicate follows cursor)
- ‚úÖ Delete with Delete key
- ‚úÖ Dimension labels below selected shapes (width √ó height)
- ‚úÖ Auto-switch to select tool after creation

**Real-Time Collaboration**
- ‚úÖ Shape sync via Firestore (all users see updates ~200ms)
- ‚úÖ Cursor tracking via Realtime DB (50ms latency)
- ‚úÖ Presence awareness (online users in header)
- ‚úÖ Shape locking prevents concurrent edits
- ‚úÖ Visual feedback (colored borders show who's editing)
- ‚úÖ Automatic lock release on deselect or disconnect
- ‚úÖ Remote cursors with names and colors
- ‚úÖ Cursor cleanup on disconnect (instant removal)

**Visual Feedback & Polish**
- ‚úÖ Inverse scaling (cursors/labels stay constant size during zoom)
- ‚úÖ Colored borders match user colors
- ‚úÖ Dimension labels remain horizontal (no rotation)
- ‚úÖ Dynamic cursors for manipulation zones
- ‚úÖ Smooth animations and transitions

### Technical Infrastructure ‚úÖ

**State Management**
- ‚úÖ Zustand stores for user, shapes, cursors
- ‚úÖ Optimistic updates (local state first, sync later)
- ‚úÖ Real-time listeners for Firestore and RTDB

**Testing**
- ‚úÖ 207 unit tests passing (Vitest)

  - 21 tests for shape/cursor/user logic
- ‚úÖ 4 integration tests (Firebase connectivity)
- ‚úÖ Anonymous auth for safe testing
- ‚úÖ Test coverage for all critical paths

**Deployment**
- ‚úÖ Vercel auto-deployment from GitHub main branch
- ‚úÖ Firebase security rules deployed (Firestore + RTDB)
- ‚úÖ Environment variables configured
- ‚úÖ Production URL: https://collab-canvas-ben-cohen.vercel.app/
- ‚úÖ HTTPS with automatic SSL

**Security**
- ‚úÖ Firestore rules prevent unauthorized writes
- ‚úÖ RTDB rules enforce user-only cursor writes
- ‚úÖ Authentication required for all canvas access
- ‚úÖ JWT tokens auto-attached to database requests

## Current Status by Component

### Frontend Components

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Canvas.tsx | ‚úÖ Complete | Pan/zoom/scroll working, needs viewport culling eventually |
| Rectangle.tsx | ‚úÖ Complete | Full manipulation (move, resize, rotate) |
| Circle.tsx | ‚ùå Not started | Next shape type to implement |
| Line.tsx | ‚ùå Not started | After circles |
| Text.tsx | ‚ùå Not started | After lines |
| Toolbar.tsx | ‚úÖ Complete | Needs expansion for more tools |
| Header.tsx | ‚úÖ Complete | Avatars and overflow working |
| AuthPage.tsx | ‚úÖ Complete | Login/signup flows solid |
| Cursor.tsx | ‚úÖ Complete | Remote cursors with inverse scaling |

### Zustand Stores

| Store | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| useUserStore | ‚úÖ Complete | Auth state and profiles working |
| useShapeStore | ‚úÖ Complete | Shapes, locking, selection working; needs duplication action |
| useCursorStore | ‚úÖ Complete | Cursor tracking and throttling working |

### Utilities & Hooks

| Utility | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| firebase.ts | ‚úÖ Complete | Initialization and config working |
| colors.ts | ‚úÖ Complete | User color generation working |
| throttle.ts | ‚úÖ Complete | Cursor throttling working |
| useFirebaseSync | ‚úÖ Complete | Real-time listeners working |
| useCanvasControls | ‚úÖ Complete | Pan/zoom/scroll working |

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Minor Issues
1. **Cursor throttling location**: Currently in component, should move to store level
2. **No error boundaries**: React errors crash entire app (should show fallback UI)
3. **No offline queue**: Writes fail silently when disconnected (should queue and retry)
4. **Lock cleanup**: Locks not released on browser crash (timeout needed?)
5. **Mobile support**: Not tested on touch devices (needs touch event handling)

### Technical Debt
1. **Firestore batching**: Individual writes for each shape update (should batch)
2. **No viewport culling**: All shapes render even if off-screen (performance concern)
3. **Duplicate manipulation code**: Resize/rotate logic may need abstraction for new shapes
4. **No operation history**: Can't implement undo/redo without tracking changes
5. **Hard-coded colors**: User colors from fixed palette (should be more diverse?)

### Performance Concerns
1. **60 FPS target**: Not profiled under heavy load (50+ shapes, 10+ users)
2. **Firebase rate limits**: Could hit free tier limits with many users (need monitoring)
3. **Cursor update frequency**: 20 Hz may be too fast for many users (adaptive throttling?)
4. **Firestore latency**: ~200ms for shape updates (consider RTDB for ephemeral edits?)

### Future Scalability Questions
1. **Multi-canvas support**: How to structure Firestore for multiple canvases per user?
2. **Permissions model**: How to implement view-only, editor, admin roles?
3. **Version history**: How to store and retrieve previous canvas states?
4. **Large canvases**: How to handle 1000+ shapes efficiently?

## Metrics & Analytics

### Test Coverage
- **Total tests**: 207 (203 unit, 4 integration)
- **Test suites**: 14
- **Pass rate**: 100%
- **Coverage**: Not measured (TODO: add coverage reporting)

### Production Usage (Manual Observation)
- **Deployed**: October 2025
- **Concurrent users tested**: Up to 3 simultaneously
- **Shapes on canvas**: Up to 20 without issues
- **Performance**: Smooth at 60 FPS with light load
- **Errors**: None reported in production so far

### Firebase Usage (Free Tier)
- **Firestore reads**: Within limits
- **Firestore writes**: Within limits
- **RTDB connections**: Within limits (100 max)
- **Auth users**: <10 accounts created

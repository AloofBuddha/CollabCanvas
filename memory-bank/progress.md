## Current Status by Component

### Frontend Components

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Canvas.tsx | ‚úÖ Complete | Pan/zoom/scroll working, needs viewport culling eventually |
| Rectangle.tsx | ‚úÖ Complete | Full manipulation (move, resize, rotate) |
| Circle.tsx | ‚ùå Not started | Next shape type to implement |
| Line.tsx | ‚ùå Not started | After circles |
| Text.tsx | ‚ùå Not started | After lines |
| Toolbar.tsx | ‚úÖ Complete | Needs expansion for more tools |
| Header.tsx | ‚úÖ Complete | Avatars and overflow working |
| AuthPage.tsx | ‚úÖ Complete | Login/signup flows solid |
| Cursor.tsx | ‚úÖ Complete | Remote cursors with inverse scaling |

### Zustand Stores

| Store | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| useUserStore | ‚úÖ Complete | Auth state and profiles working |
| useShapeStore | ‚úÖ Complete | Shapes, locking, selection working; needs duplication action |
| useCursorStore | ‚úÖ Complete | Cursor tracking and throttling working |

### Utilities & Hooks

| Utility | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| firebase.ts | ‚úÖ Complete | Initialization and config working |
| colors.ts | ‚úÖ Complete | User color generation working |
| throttle.ts | ‚úÖ Complete | Cursor throttling working |
| useFirebaseSync | ‚úÖ Complete | Real-time listeners working |
| useCanvasControls | ‚úÖ Complete | Pan/zoom/scroll working |

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Minor Issues
1. **Cursor throttling location**: Currently in component, should move to store level
2. **No error boundaries**: React errors crash entire app (should show fallback UI)
3. **No offline queue**: Writes fail silently when disconnected (should queue and retry)
4. **Lock cleanup**: Locks not released on browser crash (timeout needed?)
5. **Mobile support**: Not tested on touch devices (needs touch event handling)

### Technical Debt
1. **Firestore batching**: Individual writes for each shape update (should batch)
2. **No viewport culling**: All shapes render even if off-screen (performance concern)
3. **Duplicate manipulation code**: Resize/rotate logic may need abstraction for new shapes
4. **No operation history**: Can't implement undo/redo without tracking changes
5. **Hard-coded colors**: User colors from fixed palette (should be more diverse?)

### Performance Concerns
1. **60 FPS target**: Not profiled under heavy load (50+ shapes, 10+ users)
2. **Firebase rate limits**: Could hit free tier limits with many users (need monitoring)
3. **Cursor update frequency**: 20 Hz may be too fast for many users (adaptive throttling?)
4. **Firestore latency**: ~200ms for shape updates (consider RTDB for ephemeral edits?)

### Future Scalability Questions
1. **Multi-canvas support**: How to structure Firestore for multiple canvases per user?
2. **Permissions model**: How to implement view-only, editor, admin roles?
3. **Version history**: How to store and retrieve previous canvas states?
4. **Large canvases**: How to handle 1000+ shapes efficiently?

## Metrics & Analytics

### Test Coverage
- **Total tests**: 207 (203 unit, 4 integration)
- **Test suites**: 14
- **Pass rate**: 100%
- **Coverage**: Not measured (TODO: add coverage reporting)

### Production Usage (Manual Observation)
- **Deployed**: October 2025
- **Concurrent users tested**: Up to 3 simultaneously
- **Shapes on canvas**: Up to 20 without issues
- **Performance**: Smooth at 60 FPS with light load
- **Errors**: None reported in production so far

### Firebase Usage (Free Tier)
- **Firestore reads**: Within limits
- **Firestore writes**: Within limits
- **RTDB connections**: Within limits (100 max)
- **Auth users**: <10 accounts created

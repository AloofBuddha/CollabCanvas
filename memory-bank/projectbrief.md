# Project Brief: CollabCanvas

## Vision
Build a real-time collaborative whiteboard application (minimal Figma-style) where multiple users can edit a shared canvas simultaneously with smooth, responsive interactions.

## Core Objective
Create a production-ready collaborative canvas application that demonstrates real-time collaboration with multiple shape types, AI-powered canvas commands, and robust multi-user support. The project is evaluated against a comprehensive rubric (100 points total) covering infrastructure, features, AI integration, and technical quality.

**Current Status**: MVP Complete (v1.1) | **Target Grade**: 70-75/100 (C/C+) | **Stretch**: 80+/100 (B)

## MVP Scope (‚úÖ COMPLETE)

### In Scope
- ‚úÖ One shared canvas for all authenticated users
- ‚úÖ Authentication via Firebase (email/password)
- ‚úÖ Real-time cursor and shape synchronization
- ‚úÖ Rectangle creation, selection, movement, resize, and rotation
- ‚úÖ User presence with colored cursors and avatar initials
- ‚úÖ Toolbar UI mimicking minimal Figma aesthetics (bottom-center)
- ‚úÖ Shape locking mechanism to prevent concurrent edit conflicts
- ‚úÖ Canvas controls: pan (middle-click), zoom (Ctrl+wheel), scroll (wheel)
- ‚úÖ Unit tests via Vitest (203 passing tests)
- ‚úÖ Production deployment on Vercel

### Out of Scope (MVP)
- Additional shapes (circles, lines, text) - **NOW IN PROGRESS**
- Permissions or roles beyond createdBy metadata
- Undo/redo functionality
- Advanced performance optimization (60 FPS is goal, not MVP requirement)
- Multiple canvas workspaces
- Properties panel or layers panel

## Success Criteria

### MVP Success Criteria (‚úÖ ACHIEVED)
1. ‚úÖ Authenticated users only can access canvas
2. ‚úÖ Real-time sync with multiple users
3. ‚úÖ Accurate cursors and avatars
4. ‚úÖ Locking works smoothly with visual feedback
5. ‚úÖ Canvas state persists and restores on reload
6. ‚úÖ Stable performance under moderate load
7. ‚úÖ Deployed and publicly accessible

### Current Success Criteria (Rubric-Driven - 4 Days Remaining)

**Section 1: Core Collaborative Infrastructure (Target: 22-24/30)**
1. ‚úÖ Sub-50ms cursor sync (achieved)
2. ‚è≥ Connection status UI indicator
3. ‚è≥ Conflict resolution testing (simultaneous edits, rapid edit storm)
4. ‚è≥ Persistence testing (mid-refresh, network simulation)

**Section 2: Canvas Features & Performance (Target: 15-17/20)**
1. ‚è≥ 4+ shape types (rectangle ‚úÖ, circle, line, text)
2. ‚è≥ Multi-select with shift-click
3. ‚è≥ Performance validated with 100-300+ shapes
4. ‚è≥ 5+ concurrent users tested

**Section 3: Advanced Figma-Inspired Features (Target: 8-10/15)**
1. ‚úÖ Alt+drag duplication (Tier 1)
2. ‚è≥ Color picker with presets (Tier 1)
3. ‚è≥ Keyboard shortcuts - arrow nudging, Cmd+D, Cmd+A (Tier 1)
4. ‚è≥ Export canvas as PNG (Optional Tier 1)

**Section 4: AI Canvas Agent (Target: 15-18/25)** üö® CRITICAL
1. ‚è≥ 8+ commands across all categories (creation, manipulation, layout, complex)
2. ‚è≥ Sub-3 second response times
3. ‚è≥ 80%+ accuracy rate
4. ‚è≥ Multi-user AI support (concurrent commands)

**Section 5: Technical Implementation (8/10)** ‚úÖ STRONG
1. ‚úÖ Clean architecture with good separation
2. ‚úÖ Robust authentication and security

**Section 6: Documentation & Submission (5/5)** ‚úÖ EXCELLENT
1. ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation
2. ‚úÖ Stable deployment on Vercel

**Required Deliverables**
1. ‚è≥ AI Development Log (2-3 pages, 3 of 5 sections)
2. ‚è≥ Demo Video (3-5 min, multi-user + AI commands)

## Target Users
- Teams needing lightweight collaboration tools
- Designers prototyping basic layouts
- Educators teaching visual concepts
- Developers testing real-time sync patterns

## Key Constraints
- Stateless frontend (all state in Firebase or local memory)
- Firebase free tier limitations (writes/reads per second)
- Single shared canvas (no workspaces in MVP)
- Browser-based only (no native apps)

## Future Vision (Post-MVP)
1. **Shape Library**: Circles, ellipses, lines, arrows, text with inline editing
2. **Advanced Manipulation**: Multi-select, group operations, duplication
3. **UI Panels**: Properties panel (right), layers panel (left)
4. **Productivity**: Undo/redo, keyboard shortcuts, export/import
5. **AI Integration**: AI agent assistance (v2 feature)
6. **Performance**: Spatial partitioning, viewport-only sync, connection pooling

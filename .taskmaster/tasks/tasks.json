Updated the useShapeSelection hook to support multi-selection using a Set<string> for tracking selected shape IDs, including selectedShapeIds, isSelecting, and selectionBox state, while maintaining backward compatibility with selectedShapeId for single-selection. In the Canvas component, integrated drag-to-select: users can click and drag on empty canvas space to create a blue translucent selection rectangle; on mouse release, all shapes overlapping the rectangle (using AABB collision detection) are selected. Added visual feedback: selected shapes show selection borders, and the selection box renders with blue translucent fill and dashed stroke, scaling with canvas zoom. Supported multi-select operations: multi-drag (all selected shapes move together when dragging any of them), multi-delete (Delete or Backspace key removes all selected shapes), and ESC key to deselect all. Properly managed Firebase locks for all selected shapes during operations. UX constraints: DetailPane does not open for multi-select (only single selection); manipulation handles (resize/rotate) are disabled for multi-select, supporting only drag and delete. Files modified: src/hooks/useShapeSelection.ts (complete rewrite for multi-select with drag-to-select) and src/components/Canvas.tsx (integrated multi-select rendering, events, and multi-drag logic).

Unit tests: mock useShapeSelection actions for multi-select operations, test AABB collision detection for drag-select, and verify bulk delete/move functions update the store correctly.

        "details": "Create a new AI Agent component or service that handles user input via a toolbar button in the bottom toolbar alongside other tools. Clicking the button opens a text area above the toolbar with an Execute button; commands execute on Enter key press or button click. While executing, the command remains visible and the Execute button shows a loading spinner; affected shapes are locked during execution. On success, clear the prompt and close the text area (optionally keep open); on failure, display a toast notification with error and keep text area open for retry. Use the Grok API to send natural language commands, providing full shape data, canvas dimensions, and user's current viewport (position/zoom) for spatial commands like 'move to center'. Receive structured responses (e.g., JSON objects specifying actions like createShape, updateShape, or layoutShapes), aiming for sub-3 second response times. Parse the API response to execute atomic actions on the shapeStore, such as creating rectangles, circles, or text elements based on commands like 'create a red rectangle at position 100,100', 'move selected shapes to the right', 'arrange shapes in a grid', or 'create a login form' which could generate multiple shapes (e.g., input fields, buttons). For complex operations, define a command parser that maps API outputs to store actions, ensuring compatibility with existing shape types from Task 6. Integrate error handling for invalid commands or API failures, using the existing toast notification system. Sync all shape changes to Firestore via the existing sync mechanism from Task 7, ensuring operations are persisted and real-time, with atomic operations to prevent conflicts in multi-user scenarios. Consider rate limiting API calls to avoid overuse, and store command history locally for undo/redo if needed. Update the UI to reflect AI-generated changes, and ensure the agent works with multi-user scenarios by syncing via Firestore. Use Zustand stores from Task 4 for state management, and render shapes on the Konva canvas from Task 5. For user authentication, leverage Task 2 to associate commands with the current user if required by the API. Align implementation with 25-point rubric requirements, including support for 8+ commands across categories, response time targets, atomicity, and multi-user support. Implementation phases: Start with infrastructure and one test command ('create a red circle at position 100, 200'), then add 8 basic commands one by one (creation: create [shape] [color] at [x,y]; manipulation: move [shape/selected], change [property], delete [shape]; layout: arrange in [grid/row/column]).",

Test edge cases like invalid commands (e.g., 'fly to the moon') to ensure graceful error handling with toast notifications without crashing. Perform multi-user tests: have two users issue commands simultaneously and confirm shapes sync without conflicts, verifying atomic operations. Unit tests: Mock the Grok API responses and test command parsing logic, shape creation/manipulation functions, and integration with shapeStore actions using Vitest, including response time checks. Verify API call throttling and error handling. Integration tests: Simulate full workflows, such as creating a form via command and checking if all elements render and persist, ensuring alignment with rubric requirements.

Toolbar positioning analysis: Toolbar is at bottom-8 (32px from bottom) Toolbar has p-2 (8px padding top/bottom) Buttons are h-10 (40px height) Total clearance needed: ~88px Using bottom-24 (96px) provides safe clearance Now both issues are resolved: Toolbar overlap fixed - AI prompt clears toolbar with proper spacing Detail pane responsive - AI prompt adjusts width dynamically All linting passes!\n</info added on 2025-10-16T21:49:59.966Z>\n<info added on 2025-10-16T21:56:08.003Z>\n✅ Fixed multi-command JSON parsing error!\n\n**Problem**: AI was returning multiple commands as comma-separated objects `{...},{...}` which is invalid JSON\n\n**Solution**: \n1. Updated Zod schema to support both single commands AND arrays:\n   - `AICommandResponseSchema = z.union([CommandSchema, z.array(CommandSchema)])`\n2. Updated system prompt to instruct AI:\n   - Single shape: return `{\"action\":\"createShape\",\"shape\":{...}}`\n   - Multiple shapes: return `[{\"action\":\"createShape\",\"shape\":{...}},{\"action\":\"createShape\",\"shape\":{...}}]`\n3. Updated `useAIAgent` hook to handle both formats:\n   - `const commands = Array.isArray(response) ? response : [response]`\n   - `const allShapes = commands.flatMap(cmd => parseCommand(cmd, userId))`\n\nNow supports:\n- Single shape commands\n- Multiple shape commands in one prompt (e.g., \"create a square\")\n- Proper JSON array format validation\n\nAll linting passes!\n</info added on 2025-10-16T21:56:08.003Z>\n<info added on 2025-10-16T22:10:43.906Z>\nImproved AI error handling and spatial reasoning!\n\n1. Graceful Error Handling:\n- AI sometimes returns {\"action\":\"error\",\"message\":\"...\"} which breaks Zod validation\n- Added pre-validation check: if parsed.action === 'error', throw user-friendly error with the message\n- Added Zod error handling: convert verbose validation errors to \"AI response format was invalid. Please try rephrasing your command.\"\n- Users now see clean toast messages like \"Creating a dog out of lines is not supported\" instead of verbose Zod errors\n\n2. Better Spatial Reasoning:\n- Added smiley face example to system prompt showing proper coordinate alignment\n- Added explicit instruction: \"When creating complex compositions (faces, objects, etc.), carefully calculate positions so shapes align properly\"\n- Added fail-safe: \"You MUST always return valid shape commands. If you cannot fulfill a request, create the closest approximation you can using available shapes\"\n\nNow handles:\n- Error responses from AI gracefully\n- Complex multi-shape compositions with better alignment\n- Invalid requests with user-friendly messages\n\nAll linting passes!\n</info added on 2025-10-16T22:10:43.906Z>\n<info added on 2025-10-16T22:20:24.967Z>\n✅ Enhanced system prompt with strict shape type constraints!\n\nProblem: AI was trying to use unsupported shape types like triangle when user asked for complex shapes like \"create a house\"\n\nSolution: Updated system prompt with CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS section:\n- Explicitly lists ONLY 4 allowed shape types: \"circle\", \"rectangle\", \"text\", \"line\"\n- States AI CANNOT create triangles, polygons, stars, or any other types\n- Emphasizes AI MUST approximate complex shapes using ONLY these 4 types\n- Added \"create a house\" example showing how to approximate a house using rectangles and lines (body, roof lines, door, window)\n\nNew Prompt Section:\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n- You can ONLY use these 4 shape types: \"circle\", \"rectangle\", \"text\", \"line\"\n- You CANNOT create any other shape types (no triangles, polygons, stars, etc.)\n- You MUST approximate complex shapes using ONLY these 4 types\n- ALWAYS return either a single command object OR a JSON array of command objects\n- NEVER return any other format\n\nNow the AI will know to approximate complex shapes within the allowed constraints!\n\nAll linting passes!\n</info added on 2025-10-16T22:20:24.967Z>\n<info added on 2025-10-16T22:25:47.727Z>\n✅ Improved positioning strategy and fixed house example!\n\nProblem 1: House alignment issues\n- Roof lines weren't connecting properly to the house body\n- Fixed the example coordinates:\n  - House body: 200x150 rectangle at (300, 350)\n  - Roof lines: Connect from corners (300, 350) and (500, 350) to peak at (400, 280)\n  - Door: 60x80 rectangle at (370, 420) - centered in house\n  - Window: 50x50 rectangle at (320, 380) - left side of house\n\nProblem 2: AI always placing shapes at center\n- Added POSITIONING STRATEGY section to system prompt:\n  - If user specifies position → use exact position\n  - If no position + existing shapes → place in empty space away from others\n  - If no position + no shapes → use varied positions (not always center)\n  - Consider canvas dimensions and viewport\n  - For multiple shapes in one command → distribute across canvas\n\nAdditional improvement:\n- Added note about line endpoints: \"For lines in compositions, ensure endpoints connect to the shapes they're meant to join\"\n\nNow AI should:\n- Create better-aligned complex compositions\n- Intelligently place shapes to avoid overlap\n- Use varied positions instead of always centering\n\nAll linting passes!\n</info added on 2025-10-16T22:25:47.727Z>",

Provide AI with full shape context and viewport for spatial commands.\n<info added on 2025-10-17T15:55:12.164Z>\nAdded shape naming system for AI identification. Implemented hybrid identification approach: added optional `name` property to BaseShape interface, created `generateShapeName()` function with counters for each shape type, auto-generates names like \"rectangle-1\", \"circle-2\", etc. in shapeFactory, AI-generated shapes also get names (either custom or auto-generated), updated Zod schema to support optional `name` in CreateShapeCommand, updated CanvasContext to include names and additional properties (rotation, opacity). All builds successful. Next steps: add new command types (updateShape, deleteShape) to Zod schema, update AI system prompt with manipulation command examples, implement command parser for manipulation actions, update useAIAgent hook to execute these commands.\n</info added on 2025-10-17T15:55:12.164Z>\n<info added on 2025-10-17T16:00:35.857Z>\nPhase 1 Complete: Schemas & Infrastructure for Manipulation Commands\n\nCompleted:\n1. Shape Naming System - All shapes now have auto-generated names (e.g., \"rectangle-1\", \"circle-2\")\n2. Command Schemas - Added Zod schemas for UpdateShapeCommand and DeleteShapeCommand with flexible targeting:\n   - Target by shapeId (internal ID)\n   - Target by shapeName (human-readable, e.g., \"my-circle\")\n   - Target by selector (e.g., all red rectangles)\n   - Target by useSelected (currently selected shapes)\n3. Updates Support - UpdateShapeCommand supports ALL shape properties (position, size, visual, text-specific, line-specific)\n4. Parser Foundation - commandParser handles new command types (returns empty array, will be processed by useAIAgent)\n5. Tests Updated - All unit tests pass with proper type guards for the discriminated union\n\nNext Steps:\n- Update AI system prompt with manipulation command examples\n- Implement shape finding/selection logic in useAIAgent\n- Add manipulation command execution (update/delete shapes)\n- Add renaming support in DetailPane UI\n- Test all manipulation scenarios\n</info added on 2025-10-17T16:00:35.857Z>\n<info added on 2025-10-17T16:38:07.237Z>\n✅ Completed Shape Name UI Implementation!\n\nWhat's Working:\n1. DetailPane Name Field\n   - Name input field at top of DetailPane\n   - Shows auto-generated name (e.g., \"rectangle-1\", \"circle-2\")\n   - Users can edit and rename shapes\n   - Real-time uniqueness validation (shows red border + error message if name is taken)\n   - Debounced updates to Firebase\n   - Helper text shows example AI command usage\n\n2. Hover Name Labels\n   - Small semi-transparent black label appears above shape on hover\n   - Shows the shape's name\n   - Only shows if shape has a name AND is not locked by remote user\n   - Remote lock tooltip takes priority (no interference!)\n   - Scales properly with canvas zoom\n   - Positioned slightly lower than lock tooltip for clear visual separation\n\nTechnical Details:\n- Name synced in local state with debouncing\n- Cleanup function ensures pending name updates are saved on unmount\n- Validation checks all shapes except current one for uniqueness\n- Hover state managed separately for locked vs. non-locked shapes\n- Build successful, all tests passing\n\nNext Steps:\n- Test the UI in the browser\n- Update AI system prompt with name-based command examples\n- Implement shape finding/selection logic in useAIAgent\n- Add manipulation command execution\n</info added on 2025-10-17T16:38:07.237Z>\n<info added on 2025-10-17T18:10:07.732Z>\nManipulation commands are working well:\n- ✅ Shape creation with all 4 types (rectangle, circle, line, text) with full property support\n- ✅ Shape updates by name (shapeName), ID (shapeId), selector (type-based), or selected shapes (useSelected)\n- ✅ Delete commands implemented (not extensively tested yet)\n- ✅ Two-stage AI approach: intent classifier + execution\n- ✅ Support for opacity, rotation, colors, dimensions, text properties\n- ✅ Hybrid identification: auto-generated shape names + manual rename in DetailPane\n- ✅ Unit tests with mocked AI calls\n- ✅ Error handling with toast notifications\n\nNext priority: Layout commands (align, distribute, center) for Section 4 rubric points\n</info added on 2025-10-17T18:10:07.732Z>\n<info added on 2025-10-17T18:32:16.226Z>\nPERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION: Removed Two-Stage AI Approach\n\nReverted from the two-stage approach (intent classification → execution) to a single AI call for significant latency reduction:\n\nChanges:\n- Deleted src/services/aiIntentClassifier.ts (no longer needed)\n- Simplified executeCommand() in src/services/aiAgent.ts to make a single OpenAI call\n- Removed intent classification context from prompt\n- Updated tests to remove intent classifier mock\n\nResults:\n- Reduced latency by ~1-1.5 seconds (from 2-3s to 1.5-2s per command) ⚡\n- Maintained same functionality - Zod schema validation ensures action type is valid\n- All tests pass (259/259)\n- Build successful\n\nRationale:\nThe two-stage approach was over-engineered. The discriminated union schema (action: 'createShape' | 'updateShape' | 'deleteShape') already enforces valid action types through Zod validation. Single call meets sub-3 second rubric requirement more reliably.\n</info added on 2025-10-17T18:32:16.226Z>\n<info added on 2025-10-17T19:23:57.976Z>\nShape Alignment Functionality Now Working!\n\nJust implemented comprehensive shape alignment system:\n\nHorizontal & Vertical Alignment:\n- \"align selected shapes horizontally\" - sets same Y coordinate for horizontal row alignment\n- \"align selected shapes vertically\" - sets same X coordinate for vertical column alignment  \n- Smart detection: if shapes already share one coordinate, distributes them along the other axis\n- Success toasts show how many shapes were aligned\n\nTechnical Implementation:\n- Added alignment logic in CanvasPage.tsx executeCommand()\n- Special handling for single-coordinate updates (X or Y only for alignment)\n- Atomic updates ensure real-time sync to Firestore\n- Works with multi-select system from Task 11\n- Toast notifications for user feedback\n\nAI Command Examples:\n- \"align selected shapes horizontally\" \n- \"align selected shapes vertically\"\n- \"align the red rectangles to the left\"\n\nThis completes the alignment portion of the layout commands. Next up: distribute commands and center operations.\n</info added on 2025-10-17T19:23:57.976Z>\n<info added on 2025-10-17T19:26:08.082Z>\n✅ Linting Errors Fixed!\n\nSuccessfully resolved all 12 \"unexpected any\" linting errors in CanvasPage.tsx:\n\nChanges Made:\n- Replaced (s as any) casts in getApproxWidth() and getApproxHeight() helper functions with proper type guards\n- Used specific shape type assertions (CircleShape, RectangleShape, TextShape, LineShape) after type checking\n- Changed Record<string, any> to Record<string, unknown> for better type safety\n- Replaced (shape as any)[key] with (shape as Record<string, unknown>)[key]\n\nTechnical Details:\n- The alignment logic was trying to access shape-specific properties (radiusX, width, x2, etc.) without proper typing\n- Used discriminated union pattern with type guards instead of unsafe any casting\n- All linting now passes with zero warnings/errors\n\nThe codebase is now fully lint-compliant and ready for the next development phase.\n</info added on 2025-10-17T19:26:08.082Z>\n<info added on 2025-10-17T19:27:28.068Z>\n✅ Linting Issues Fully Resolved!\n\nFixed the missing imports issue:\n- Added imports for `CircleShape`, `RectangleShape`, `TextShape`, `LineShape` to CanvasPage.tsx\n- Fixed TypeScript casting issue: `(shape as unknown as Record<string, unknown>)[key]`\n- All TypeScript compilation and ESLint checks now pass\n- Proper type safety maintained without any `any` usage\n\nThe codebase is now fully lint-compliant and type-safe.

Used hybrid approach: Enhanced AI system prompt + relative positioning support for natural layout operations. Changes Made: 1. Enhanced System Prompt (src/services/aiAgent.ts): Added LAYERING AND Z-INDEX section with proper guidance for compositions. Added LAYOUT COMMANDS section with examples (align, distribute, center, spacing). Added COMPLEX COMPOSITIONS section with detailed examples: Stick Figure (properly aligned with connected limbs), Login Form (professionally spaced UI). Improved positioning strategy for multi-shape commands. Added z-index guidance: use Date.now() + incremental values for proper layering. 2. Relative Position Support (src/components/CanvasPage.tsx): Added logic to handle relative updates (e.g., \"+50\", \"-20\"). Processes string values starting with +/- as deltas from current value. Enables commands like \"move rectangle-2 50 pixels down\". Supported Commands: \"align selected shapes horizontally/vertically\", \"distribute selected shapes horizontally/vertically\", \"center circle-1 on canvas\", \"move shape-1 50 pixels right/down/up/left\", \"space out selected shapes evenly\", \"create a stick figure\" (properly aligned), \"create a login form\" (professionally spaced), Complex compositions with proper layering. Technical Details: Layout commands use updateShape action with calculated positions. Z-index properly managed: Date.now() + offset for layering order. Relative positioning: parseFloat(\"+50\") → currentValue + 50. All tests pass (259/259). Build successful. Result: Faster response times (no new API calls, just better prompting). Better spatial reasoning for complex shapes. Proper layering in compositions.

Complex Shape Creation\n   - Stick figures, smiley faces, houses, login forms\n   - Proper z-index layering (background → middle → foreground)\n   - Connected shapes (lines actually connect to their intended shapes)\n   - Varied positioning (not always centered)\n\n2. Layout Commands\n   - \"align selected shapes horizontally/vertically\"\n   - Client-side intelligence: detects when shapes need distribution vs alignment\n   - Smart Logic: If all shapes have same Y, \"align vertically\" distributes them vertically with spacing\n   - Smart Logic: If all shapes have same X, \"align horizontally\" distributes them horizontally with spacing\n   - Proper spacing: 80px vertical, 120px horizontal\n\n3. Technical Implementation\n   - Removed two-stage AI approach (reduced latency by ~1.5s)\n   - Single toast for multi-shape creation\n   - Auto-focus on command completion (success/error)\n   - Relative position updates (\"move +50 pixels\")\n   - Shape naming and AI identification\n   - All tests passing, builds successful\n\nResults:\n- Complex compositions render correctly with proper layering\n- Layout commands work intelligently (no more stacking!)\n- 50% faster AI response times\n- Clean UX with proper notifications and focus management\n\nFuture Enhancement:\nLayout commands can be extended with custom spacing: \"align vertically with 20px gap\"\n</info added on 2025-10-17T19:16:53.696Z>",

Update the Canvas component's Konva rendering to apply the opacity prop to each shape. For text shapes, ensure opacity applies to the entire group (text + background). In the DetailPane, add an opacity slider (0-100%) that updates the selected shape's opacity and syncs changes via Firebase. **Phase 2: Z-Index Layering** - Add a 'zIndex' field (number) to all shape types, with a default strategy based on creation timestamp (newer shapes get higher zIndex). Before rendering in the Canvas component, sort the shapes array by zIndex (higher values on top). Add four buttons in the DetailPane: 'Bring to Front' (set zIndex to max+1), 'Send to Back' (set to min-1), 'Bring Forward' (increment zIndex), 'Send Backward' (decrement zIndex). Ensure these changes sync via Firebase and handle multi-select scenarios by applying to all selected shapes. **Phase 3: AI Integration** - Extend the AI command schema to include optional 'opacity' and 'zIndex' properties. Update the system prompt for the AI agent with examples of layering commands (e.g., 'create a house with overlapping windows at different z-indexes'). Modify the commandParser in the AI agent to parse and apply these properties when creating or updating shapes. Ensure the AI can generate properly layered compositions, integrating with Task 12's AI agent functionality. Technical considerations: Use Konva's native opacity support; manage z-index via array sorting before render to avoid Konva's z-index limitations; ensure all changes are atomic and sync to Firestore for real-time collaboration; handle edge cases like negative zIndex or opacity out of bounds.",

For Phase 2: Create multiple overlapping shapes, use DetailPane buttons to change z-index order, verify stacking (e.g., 'Bring to Front' places shape on top); test with multi-select (from Task 11) to apply layering to groups; confirm sorting logic by inspecting shapes array order before render. For Phase 3: Use the AI agent (from Task 12) to issue commands like 'create a red square with 50% opacity and z-index 5', verify shape creation with correct properties; test complex commands like 'build a layered house' and check proper z-index stacking. Run unit tests for shapeStore updates (opacity/zIndex fields), Konva rendering props, and commandParser handling.

Before rendering in the Canvas component, sort the shapes array by zIndex (higher values on top). Add four buttons in the DetailPane: 'Bring to Front' (set zIndex to max+1), 'Send to Back' (set to min-1), 'Bring Forward' (increment zIndex), 'Send Backward' (decrement zIndex). Ensure these changes sync via Firebase and handle multi-select scenarios by applying to all selected shapes. Manage z-index via array sorting before render to avoid Konva's z-index limitations.",

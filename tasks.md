## MVP Checkpoint âœ…

**Core Requirements:**
- [x] Basic canvas with pan/zoom (middle-click pan, wheel scroll, Ctrl+wheel zoom)
- [x] At least one shape type (rectangle with drag functionality)
- [x] Ability to create and move objects
- [x] Real-time sync between 2+ users via Firestore
- [x] Multiplayer cursors with name labels and colors
- [x] Presence awareness (who's online in header)
- [x] User authentication (email/password signup/login with profiles)
- [x] Deployed and publicly accessible (Vercel + Firebase)

**ðŸŽ‰ Live at: https://collab-canvas-ben-cohen.vercel.app/**

**Test Coverage:**
- [x] 146 unit tests across 10 test suites
- [x] All core stores tested (user, cursor, shape)
- [x] Authentication and validation tested
- [x] Firebase presence and locking logic tested

## PR #9 - Rectangle Manipulation (Resize & Rotate) âœ…

**Goal:** Add interactive manipulation to rectangles with visual feedback

### Dimension Display
* [x] Show dimensions (width Ã— height) below selected rectangle
* [x] Dimension text remains horizontal regardless of shape rotation
* [x] Dimension text positioned below shape bounds
* [x] Dimension text scales inversely with zoom (constant size)

### Cursor Feedback
* [x] Standard drag cursor over center/body of rectangle (existing)
* [x] Resize cursors on corners (nwse-resize, nesw-resize)
* [x] Resize cursors on edges (ew-resize for left/right, ns-resize for top/bottom)
* [x] Rotation cursor when hovering near corners (outside shape bounds)
* [x] Define hit zones for corners, edges, and rotation areas

### Resize Functionality
* [x] Corner resize: drag to resize width and height simultaneously
* [x] Edge resize: drag to resize width or height independently
* [x] Maintain opposite corner/edge position during resize
* [x] Update shape dimensions in Firestore on resize
* [x] Prevent negative dimensions (minimum size)
* [x] Visual feedback during resize (live preview)

### Rotation Functionality
* [x] Detect rotation zone (outside corners, within threshold)
* [x] Calculate rotation angle based on mouse position relative to shape center
* [x] Update shape rotation in real-time during drag
* [x] Sync rotation to Firestore
* [x] Show rotation angle indicator (optional - skipped)

### Testing & Polish
* [x] Unit tests for hit zone detection logic (34 tests total)
* [x] Unit tests for resize calculations (including smooth flipping)
* [x] Unit tests for rotation calculations
* [x] Fix cursor feedback for manipulation zones
* [x] Fix rotation zone detection and interaction (larger 30px zones)
* [x] Implement smooth shape flipping that follows mouse
* [x] Fix rotation to pivot around center (not top-left)
* [x] Hide dimension label during manipulation
* [x] Improve rotation zone accessibility (starts right at corner edge)
* [x] Manual test all manipulation modes (cursors, resize, rotate, flip)
* [x] Ensure manipulation respects shape locking (multi-user)
* [x] Test with zoom and pan transformations
* [x] Fix shape deselection on mouseup outside shape bounds

### Key Improvements
* **Rotation pivot:** Shapes now rotate around their center (using Konva offsetX/offsetY)
* **Rotation zones:** Increased to 30px for easier triggering, start right at corner edge
* **Smooth flipping:** Shape follows mouse cursor during resize past anchor point
* **Dimension label:** Automatically hidden during drag/rotation, visible during resize
* **Selection persistence:** Shapes stay selected after resize/rotate regardless of mouseup location
* **Event timing fix:** Handle onClick firing before onMouseUp by checking current operation states
* **Anonymous auth:** Firebase integration tests now use anonymous authentication
* **React keys:** Fixed React key warning using Fragment components
* **Test count:** 203 passing tests (36 new tests for manipulation)

### Performance & Architecture
* [ ] **Clarify "persistence layer" requirement** - Local storage backup? Session restore?
* [ ] **Clarify "refresh mid-edit" requirement** - Should maintain position/selection on reload?
* [ ] **Measure and optimize for 60 FPS goal:**
  * Set up FPS monitoring/profiling
  * Identify bottlenecks (Firebase latency? Rendering?)
  * Evaluate Firebase Realtime DB performance limits
  * Consider Firebase paid tier for higher throughput
  * Consider optimistic updates for better perceived performance
  * Evaluate batching shape updates vs individual writes

### UX Improvements
* [ ] Add subtle grid background to canvas
* [ ] Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl+D duplicate, Cmd/Ctrl+Z undo)
* [ ] Context menu (right-click) for shape actions
* [ ] Snap-to-grid functionality
* [ ] Export/import canvas state (JSON)
* [ ] Anonymous guest access for quick testing

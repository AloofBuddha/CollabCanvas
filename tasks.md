## Future Enhancements

### Additional Shape Types
* [ ] Implement circle/ellipse shape creation
* [ ] Implement line/arrow shape creation
* [ ] Implement text shape with inline editing
* [ ] Add shape type selector to toolbar

### Shape Manipulation
* [ ] Resize shapes with corner/edge handles
* [ ] Rotate shapes with rotation handle
* [ ] Alt+drag to duplicate shapes
* [ ] Display shape dimensions in label below selected shape

### Selection Features
* [ ] Multiple selection with Shift+click
* [ ] Drag-to-select rectangle (translucent selection box)
* [ ] Group move for multi-selected shapes
* [ ] Delete multiple shapes at once

### Properties Panel
* [ ] Right-aligned properties panel (visible when shape selected)
* [ ] Editable position (X, Y coordinates)
* [ ] Editable rotation angle
* [ ] Color picker for fill color
* [ ] Opacity slider (0-100%)
* [ ] Width/height inputs for dimensions

### Layers Panel
* [ ] Left-aligned layers panel
* [ ] List all shapes with names/icons
* [ ] Drag-n-drop to reorder shape z-index
* [ ] Show/hide layer visibility toggle
* [ ] Lock/unlock layers for editing

### Performance & Architecture
* [ ] **Clarify "persistence layer" requirement** - Local storage backup? Session restore?
* [ ] **Clarify "refresh mid-edit" requirement** - Should maintain position/selection on reload?
* [ ] **Measure and optimize for 60 FPS goal:**
  * Set up FPS monitoring/profiling
  * Identify bottlenecks (Firebase latency? Rendering?)
  * Evaluate Firebase Realtime DB performance limits
  * Consider Firebase paid tier for higher throughput
  * Consider optimistic updates for better perceived performance
  * Evaluate batching shape updates vs individual writes

### UX Improvements
* [ ] Add subtle grid background to canvas
* [ ] Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl+D duplicate, Cmd/Ctrl+Z undo)
* [ ] Context menu (right-click) for shape actions
* [ ] Snap-to-grid functionality
* [ ] Export/import canvas state (JSON)
* [ ] Anonymous guest access for quick testing
